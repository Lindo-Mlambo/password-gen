# Password Generator

This is a pet project, might improve it some other time.
I just have these small ideas and decide to work on the thing and... ja

I am inspired by Frontend Mentor, if I am out of ideas I just go on in there and pick a challenge. It's fun ðŸ˜Š

Feel free to use the code however you want. Infact, you should actually write a better algorithm for generating the password,
I just patched it up and made it to work... Not so much of an algorithm really

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Continued Delevelopment

I was just thinking that the password generation part of this project makes a good candidate for TDD?
Maybe one day when I remember that this project exists, I will come back and try build the password generator using TDD.
I am familiar with the theory, I haven't had a chance to put it to practice but I am looking forward to it
